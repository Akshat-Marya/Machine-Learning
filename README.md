# Machine-Learning

This is some of the stuff that I'm working on. It is not perfect in any way or sense, and most, if not all of the code can be improved in some way or another if I had more time to spend on it.

<b>ML_notes.pdf</b> contains detailed notes about few topics on machine leanring like supervised and unsupervised learning.
